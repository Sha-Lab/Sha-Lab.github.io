abstract: "We propose a novel supervised learning technique for summarizing
videos by automatically selecting keyframes or key subshots.
Casting the task as a structured prediction problem, our main idea is
to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to model the variable-range
temporal dependency among video frames, so as to derive both representative
and compact video summaries. The proposed model successfully
accounts for the sequential structure crucial to generating meaningful
video summaries, leading to state-of-the-art results on two benchmark
datasets. In addition to advances in modeling techniques, we introduce
a strategy to address the need for a large amount of annotated data for
training complex learning approaches to summarization. There, our main
idea is to exploit auxiliary annotated video summarization datasets, in
spite of their heterogeneity in visual styles and contents. Specifically, we
show that domain adaptation techniques can improve learning by reducing
the discrepancies in the original datasetsâ€™ statistical properties."
