    title: "Synthesized Policies for Transfer and Adaptation across Tasks and Environments"
    excerpt: 'The ability to transfer in reinforcement learning is key towards building an agent of general artificial intelligence. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning to simultaneously transfer across both environments (ENV) and tasks (TASK), probably more importantly, by learning from only sparse (ENV, TASK) pairs out of all the possible combinations. We propose a novel compositional neural network architecture which depicts a meta rule for composing policies from environment and task embeddings.'
