We are primarily interested in fundamental research questions in statistical machine learning. Our goal is to invent new statistical models, inference methods and computational algorithms.

Statistical machine learning is a vast field that has rapidly changing the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Our collaborations and us have worked on many subareas in machine learning. Our past (and ongoing) research topics include: 

1. unsupervised learning including probabilistic latent variable models and dimensionality reduction; 
2. supervised learning especially under data paucity (or learning with small data): multi-task learning, transfer learning, zero-shot learning and domain adaptation; 
3. representation learning for automatically inferring useful features from data: learning kernels and metrics, deep learning architectures, etc; 
4. large-scale machine learning systems and algorithms: distributed optimization, large-scale kernel methods, etc.

Our research agenda is often inspired by many AI problems: speech and language processing, computer vision, robotics, and others.

Most recently, we have branched into applying machine learning (and other AI techniques) to **life** and **medical** sciences. Many unique opportunities and challenges arise in those domains. For example, we are very interested in both theoretical and applied topics in learning for decision making (such as clinical trial, personalized and precision treatment, etc).
